## ELCImagePickerController

# ELCImagePickerController

*A clone of the UIImagePickerController using the Assets Library Framework allowing for multiple asset selection.*

## Usage

The image picker is created and displayed in a very similar manner to the `UIImagePickerController`. The sample application  shows its use. To display the controller you instantiate it and display it modally like so.

```obj-c
// Create the image picker
ELCImagePickerController *imagePicker = [[ELCImagePickerController alloc] init];
imagePicker.maximumImagesCount = 4; //Set the maximum number of images to select, defaults to 4
imagePicker.imagePickerDelegate = self;

//Present modally
[self presentViewController:elcPicker animated:YES completion:nil];

// Release if not using ARC
[imagePicker release];
```

The `ELCImagePickerController` will return the select images back to the `ELCImagePickerControllerDelegate`. The delegate contains methods very similar to the `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`. Instead of returning one dictionary representing a single image the controller sends back an array of similarly structured dictionaries. The two delegate methods are:

```obj-c
- (void)elcImagePickerController:(ELCImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSArray *)info;
- (void)elcImagePickerControllerDidCancel:(ELCImagePickerController *)picker;
```

The Image Picker allows for some customization, including limiting 
    to just one photo album, limiting to single image selection, and automatically
    scrolling to the bottom. See the demo viewcontroller for example usage.
